# SoldierMacro
Since its really hard to find a Macro that works now days for free and I always need to worry about keyloggers, I'm doing one myself for fun.  (use it wisely, I'm not responsible for your mistakes), (I'm doing it as a beginner and for fun, things will crash often for sure.)

But there still some bugs to fix, and some to discover, but since I don't use it often, rarely I find them.
