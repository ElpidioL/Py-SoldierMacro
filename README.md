# SoldierMacro
Since its really hard to find a Macro that works now days for free and I always need to worry about keyloggers, I'm doing one myself for fun.  (use it wisely, I'm not responsible for your mistakes)


Its looking like this RN

But there still some bugs to fix, and some to discover, but since I don't use it often, rarely I find them.


Obs: this program is really bad designed, i did it on the fly because i needed a macro, it has a lot of problems that i'm aware of and not trying to fix, since it works that way for me.
